Wisdom Extract of: (S1 E1 - How to literally do anything Quantum Manifestation - Marina Jacobi - law of attraction)

SUMMARY:
Marina Jacobi and Joe Penna discuss manifestation and the quantum structure.

IDEAS:
- Everything is made from frequencies of light and sound that combine to create plasma
- You are the structure, the universe, the quantum field, projecting your reality
- Parallel realities exist simultaneously; you shift between them based on thoughts and emotions
- Staying in a negative emotion crystallizes a negative timeline; positive shifts to positive
- You cannot imagine something if you don't know its vibration in the quantum field
- Believe and want something to happen without questioning or expecting a specific outcome
- Agreements and lessons may need to be completed before certain manifestations can occur
- God is not outside of you; you are God, made from the quantum structure
- When interacting with others, project positive emotions to shift to a positive outcome
- Accept what is with gratitude; imagine what you want without expectations of how
- Pass lessons with excellence, through the heart and positivity, to gain needed knowledge
- Dimensional manifestation is attraction of similar vibrational frequencies in the quantum field
- Keep vibrating positively moment to moment, even if others are being negative
- Binaural beats can be a permission slip to calm and expand consciousness for some
- Humanity's process involves some learning through challenges to enable mass awakening
- Ringing in the ears may be picking up frequencies as part of the ascension process

INSIGHTS:
- We are the quantum structure itself, not separate from the field of infinite possibility
- Our thoughts, emotions and actions are constantly shifting us between parallel realities
- Manifestation requires 100% belief without expectations of specific outcomes or timing 
- Interacting positively with others, regardless of their actions, shifts us to positive realities
- Challenges and delays in manifestation may be due to soul agreements and lessons
- Money is an illusion; staying in gratitude and positivity attracts all forms of abundance
- Awakening humanity involves some souls undergoing difficulties to catalyze collective growth
- Ascension symptoms like ear ringing are frequencies moving us into higher consciousness
- The true self vibrates from the heart with unconditional love; that manifests infinity
- Mastering manifestation means instantaneous results with a single positive thought

QUOTES:
- "You are the structure. There is nothing outside of you. You are the creator."
- "If you believe something and if you want something to happen, you cannot question the outcome."
- "You have to let go of any expectations of what you want to do and how you're going to do it."
- "It's an illusion. Your hologram, you're manifesting. It doesn't matter if you have one dollar or 1 million dollar."
- "Do not put condition in the structure. If you put a condition in the structure, if you have expectations, you're going to perceive back everything with conditioning to you."
- "It doesn't matter what somebody else is doing. What matter is the vibration, the emotion and the deeds that you're projecting at that time."
- "You cannot perceive something if you're not the vibration of it."
- "Do not put a condition and start giving out of your heart, because your true self vibrates from the heart, vibrates from the love structure."

HABITS:
- Shifting emotions to the positive immediately when feeling out of alignment
- Expressing gratitude for everything, accepting what is, to enable manifestation
- Imagining desired outcomes without expectations of how they will come about
- Interacting with others from the heart with unconditional positivity 
- Persisting in positive vibration moment to moment to crystallize positive timelines
- Recognizing challenges as opportunities to learn, grow and help others
- Letting synchronicities and intuition guide actions in the flow of manifestation
- Practicing manifestation principles consistently to increase speed and ease of results

FACTS:
- The quantum field is made of light and sound frequencies that combine into plasma
- Parallel realities exist simultaneously and we shift between them with each thought
- The higher the frequency of your reality, the closer it is to ET consciousness 
- There is no time; all possible realities already exist in the quantum field
- Agreements made before birth may require certain lessons to be completed
- Religion and science both understand the quantum structure but have been separated
- Ringing in the ears is a common symptom of picking up ascension frequencies
- Instantaneous manifestation is possible by holding a single positive thought

Wisdom Extract of: (S1 E2 - QM Code - Mobilizing Structures - Marina Jacobi Co-host Joe Pena)

SUMMARY:
Marina Jacobi presents a deep dive into the quantum structure of reality and how to manifest your desired reality by controlling your emotions, thoughts and actions moment-to-moment. Co-hosted by Joe Pena.

IDEAS:
- Everything in the quantum field is based on plasma, magnetic and gravitational fields interacting
- Consciousness is one particle flickering next to itself infinitely, creating parallel realities 
- You can only recall a reality if you know its vibrational frequency
- You are shifting between parallel realities moment to moment based on your vibration
- To manifest, disengage from negativity, find neutrality, then project the positive reality you want
- Gratitude neutralizes negative situations and allows you to project a positive outcome
- Affirmations stating what you want in the now are effective for steady positive projection
- We each individually create our own ascension process through our moment-to-moment projections
- Even if you still see negativity, keep projecting the positive reality you want to experience

INSIGHTS:
- You are the creator of your reality, shifting between infinite parallel realities moment-to-moment
- Your emotions are the remote control that determine which parallel reality you project and experience  
- Neutrality/zero point allows you to consciously choose the reality you want to project
- Increasing the intensity of positive emotion makes the projection into the quantum field more potent
- Letting go of past hurts allows you to crystallize a completely new and different positive timeline
- Ascension is an individual process based on consistently projecting positive frequencies
- All negativity that doesn't match 5D frequencies will eventually disappear from your timeline
- Time is fractal - each moment you are projecting a completely new reality

QUOTES:
- "Consciousness is made of one particle that is vibrating in a very high speed of vibration, and it's appearing next to itself, next to itself, next to itself to infinite number. That's what consciousness is."
- "At the moment you think 100%, remember manifestation is 100%, all of a sudden that becomes a reality for you."
- "Manifestation in a quantum is now. You co-exist simultaneously everywhere."
- "Every moment to moment to moment you creating a brand new and brand new and brand new parallel reality every moment."
- "Consciousness is one particle that is flickering next to itself, next to itself, next to itself, to infinite amount of parallel realities, and you coexist at the same time."

HABITS:
- Pull yourself out of negative situations and find neutrality/zero point before choosing your response
- Switch your emotions to the positive like an actor, really feeling it, to project that reality
- Pay attention to your thoughts and imaginings, as you are constantly projecting those frequencies
- Express gratitude even for challenging situations to neutralize them and allow positive projection
- Examine if your motivations are coming from ego or the heart when making choices

FACTS:
- Consciousness is made of one particle flickering next to itself infinitely fast
- You are shifting between parallel realities every moment based on the frequency you are projecting
- Manifestation happens in the now moment, not in the future
- Intense positive emotion makes your reality projection into the quantum field more potent 
- We are each individually responsible for our own ascension process through our frequency projection

REFERENCES:
- Marina Jacobi's previous Quantum Manifestation webinar 
- Books on nanotechnology and the harmonic reactor on Marina's website

Wisdom Extract of: (S2 E7 - QM - False Pretense and Lies - Marina Jacobi co-host Joe Pena)

SUMMARY: 
Marina Jacobi discusses how deception, lies and manipulation affect the quantum structure and manifest negative realities, while operating from the heart creates positive realities aligned with the 5D consciousness shift happening now.

IDEAS:
- Deceiving others creates a split frequency that no longer resonates with the 5D heart structure. 
- This causes the deceiver's reality to collapse into a negative holographic impression.
- Operating from the heart while using money collapses the 3D/5D realities into an abundant 5D structure.
- Giving without condition, even if charging for services, trains the vibration towards abundance.
- Consciousness is shifting to a 5D heart-based structure, making deception unsustainable long-term.
- Take action from the heart, not just thoughts/emotions, to manifest the desired reality.
- Forgive deceivers, establish boundaries, but don't retaliate as that lowers your frequency.
- Synchronicities reveal areas requiring realignment; follow guidance towards the highest vibrational resonance.
- Nightmares may reflect past life agreements; seek qualified assistance for entity attachments.
- Consistent heart-based actions, allowing without condition, will collapse your reality into 5D abundance.

INSIGHTS:
- Deception creates a split reality that inevitably collapses into a negative structure.
- Aligning actions with heart resonance collapses 3D/5D realities into an abundant 5D experience. 
- Consistent heart-centered giving, allowing, and gratitude accelerates the shift to 5D consciousness.

- Letting go of negative emotions and resonating positive ones creates instantaneous healing and manifestation.
- The geometric structure of reality contains infinite nested realities/universes existing simultaneously.
- Our consciousness projects holograms, including the experiences and versions of others we perceive.
- Practicing resonating a steady high vibration creates the permanent manifestation of desired timelines.
- Negative emotions keep recreating similar experiences until the lesson of transforming them is learned.
- Physical practices like sound healing can help realign and harmonize our energy systems.
- Discernment is required regarding sources of information resonating truth versus promoting fear programming.

INSIGHTS:
- Our holographic experience is a direct projection of our vibrational resonance moment-to-moment.
- Mastering emotional self-regulation is key to consciously creating and shifting reality experiences.
- All geometric forms and experiences are holographically contained within the unified quantum field.
- Consistent high-vibrational practices reprogram our consciousness to manifest our desired reality streams.
- Detaching from fear-based narratives and embodying heart-centered resonance is crucial for ascension.

QUOTES:
"Every single pixel which is the vibrational signal in this reality it's an own hologram, its own structure, its own earth."

"Based on the vibration that you're shooting towards that you're shooting that in your holographic matrix and based on that vibration you're shifting the next momentum into and you're creating a brand new earth with another version of you."

"If you don't learn how to control it they cannot promise you how you're gonna create your realities in a positive because you keep resonating and keep repeating and reprinting the frequency of the same of the next momentum."

"You need to shift and rewire the whole structure with a brand new frequency."

"Negative one plus one equals zero point and how is that happening so let's learn that through the quantum structure."

"This is how the structure works to have everything in a quantum, in a now, simultaneously running."

"You're basically shifting also timelines right here from one to another."

"This is the reason why simultaneously running. Because you basically have the structure the way it's built through the frequency vibration creates that geometry and creates simultaneously platforms at the same time."

"All that is basically from the one molecule. So they said that, they said here's your quantum, here's your zero point, here's your new reality, here's a new parallel and they said here is your new universe."

"You need to learn how to control the frequency that you're taking when that when something happens you take that energetic force very clearly and you're so powerful that that energy comes in at once but if it comes at once you need to know how to control it."

- Positive/negative frequencies combine into a zero-point shift into a new hologram.
- Each apparent "pixel" or point is an entire holographic universe branching infinitely.
- The illusion of time arises from the fractal delay between holograms updating.
- Consciousness projects reality based on its vibrational resonance, including perceived others' experiences.
- Mastering emotional self-regulation is key to locking in desired reality trajectories.
- Forgiveness and compassion expand consciousness, judgment and resistance create further entanglement.
